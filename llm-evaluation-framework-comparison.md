## LLM Evaluation Frameworks Comparison: LangSmith, Opik, and Langfuse

### Framework Overviews

#### LangSmith (by LangChain)
LangSmith is a platform focused on the evaluation, debugging, and monitoring of LLM applications, whether built with LangChain or not. Its primary strengths are extensive trace logging, customizable evaluation criteria (including both automated and human-in-the-loop scoring), real-time monitoring, and robust dataset management for regression testing. It integrates tightly with CI/CD pipelines and is designed for both development (pre-release) and production scenarios[1][2][3][4].

#### Opik (by Comet)
Opik is a fully open-source framework for evaluating, testing, and monitoring LLM applications. It emphasizes an end-to-end workflow with deep tracing, experiment management, CI/CD integration, and dashboard analytics. Key features include LLM-as-a-judge evaluation metrics, guardrails for safe/applicable outputs, and high-volume trace support for robust production monitoring. Opik is framework-agnostic and supports a broad set of integrations[5][6][7][8].

#### Langfuse
Langfuse is an open-source, self-hostable observability and analytics platform for LLM applications. Its main differentiator is extensive, fine-grained tracing and multi-modal support (text, images, audio). Langfuse offers comprehensive metrics across latency, cost, and quality; it supports versioning, prompt management, session tracking, and deep agent workflow visualizations. Langfuse is highly extensible, API-first, and integrates with 50+ libraries/frameworks[9][10][11][12][13].
